### **1. Overview of Methodologies**

#### **Agile**
- **Definition**: Iterative and incremental approach focusing on collaboration, customer feedback, and flexibility.
- **Core Principles**:
  - Deliver working software frequently.
  - Embrace changing requirements.
  - Foster collaboration between teams and customers.

#### **Waterfall**
- **Definition**: A linear and sequential methodology where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
- **Core Principles**:
  - Plan everything upfront.
  - Follow a strict sequence: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment.

#### **Lean**
- **Definition**: Originating from manufacturing, Lean focuses on minimizing waste, maximizing value, and optimizing flow.
- **Core Principles**:
  - Eliminate waste.
  - Deliver value quickly.
  - Continuously improve.

### **3. Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Agile**
- **Process**:
  - Work is broken into sprints or iterations (e.g., 2-4 weeks).
  - Regularly deliver working software.
  - Review and adjust based on feedback in retrospectives.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.
  - Frequent delivery increases customer satisfaction.
  - Collaborative and transparent process.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires skilled teams and high customer involvement.
  - Difficult to predict costs and timelines.
  - Less emphasis on documentation.
- **Best Suited For**:
  - Dynamic projects where requirements are unclear or likely to evolve (e.g., software development).

#### **Waterfall**
- **Process**:
  - Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment.
  - Phases are executed in sequence.
  - No phase begins until the previous one is completed.
- **Advantages**:
  - Clear structure and predictable timelines.
  - Well-suited for projects with fixed requirements.
  - Extensive documentation ensures continuity.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Inflexible to changes once a phase is completed.
  - Late discovery of issues (testing occurs after development).
  - Limited customer involvement during development.
- **Best Suited For**:
  - Projects with well-defined requirements and low likelihood of change (e.g., construction, hardware development).

#### **Lean**
- **Process**:
  - Focus on delivering value by eliminating waste.
  - Continuous improvement and feedback loops.
  - Teams are empowered to make decisions.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces waste and inefficiencies.
  - Focused on delivering customer value.
  - Encourages continuous improvement and innovation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires a cultural shift in organizations.
  - Overemphasis on eliminating waste can overlook other priorities.
  - Difficult to implement in rigid or siloed environments.
- **Best Suited For**:
  - Projects where efficiency and value delivery are critical (e.g., manufacturing, startups).
